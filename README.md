# snake_gpt4
Clone of the videogame "Snake" built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript - all by leveraging GPT-4. It's a simple experiment to evaluate the performance of GPT-4 by reducing the human code to 0.

The only human contribution was limited to Prompt Engineering, Testing and Feedback to the model

# the game
The game is a simple clone of the videogame Snake, but with a multiplayer nature, it supports playing against the CPU or against a second player (which would move using the WASD keys).

# touch controls
The game also supports touch controls (for player 1) using swipes up, left, down or right

# the objective
The game ends when one of the two players reaches 250 points, when the snakes' heads collide or when the snake head collides with any part of its own body.

# power up
a power up is spawned in between 5 and 15 seconds of game, the power up simply makes the opponent snake 0.75 slower.
